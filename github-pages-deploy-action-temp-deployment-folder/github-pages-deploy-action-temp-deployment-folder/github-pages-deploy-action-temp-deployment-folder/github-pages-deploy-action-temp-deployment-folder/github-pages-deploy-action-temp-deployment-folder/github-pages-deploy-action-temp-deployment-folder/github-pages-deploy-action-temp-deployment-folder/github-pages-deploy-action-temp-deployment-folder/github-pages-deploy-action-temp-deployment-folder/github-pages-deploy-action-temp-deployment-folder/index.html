      <p>The day when it all started ❤️. We held hands for the FIRST TIME when you helped me climb the boat. You gave me warmth with your jacket when I was feeling cold.</p>

      <p>Thanks for coming to celebrate my birthday with me. Sorry I had spoiled the SURPRISE you had made for me back then, but even at the moment I got to know you would be coming on my birthday I felt like the happiest girl in the world. Thanks for leaving behind your CRICKET match's final for ME.</p>

    <!-- IMAGE 7 -->
    <div class="photo-card">
      <img src="images/image7.jpg" alt="Memory 7" />
      <p>I was not really planning to share this with you but now looking back at this picture I do remember crying non stop on our way from pune to mumbai when you got confused and lost on the right way and I wasn't much responsive you yelled at me, and at that moment I realised even you too do scold people and because it was the first time you scolded me my couldn't help bursting out but somehow you never really noticed me crying at the seat beside you throughout for an hour almost broke my heart even more. But when we reached Marine Drive I had forgotton everything and It was just a peaceful feeling beside you as if we were meant to be and we will overcome all the hardships together ❤️</p>
